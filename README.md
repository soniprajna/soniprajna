### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

\<tldr\> I am an interdisciplinary, capable and dedicated individual passionate about Tech for Social Impact and exploring the highest and lowest points of nature. \<\/tldr\>

My name is Prajna Soni and I'm currently a Postgraduate Research Fellow at NYU Abu Dhabi working on a project to quantify the predictive power of global open datasets in an attempt to mitigate the effects of the global data gap. 

I am a 2020 graduate from New York University Abu Dhabi, with a major in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. 

I am driven by a constant desire to learn and grow while contributing to a meaningful solution. This has led me through a variety of experiences from independently designing and installing a photo-voltaic system, to training a computer model to predict the success of early stage start-ups using data mining, to creating a VR game to stimulate physiological development in toddlers. This self-driven attitude ensures that I take the initiative to learn and explore beyond what is expected for a project, thus delivering successful and holistic results. 

When not in class, I like to work on short, self-assigned projects to further my skills and abilities, and develop my understanding of the world we live in. My first and foremost passion is learning. 

I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities where I can apply my skills in engineering, computer science, problem solving, and leadership to create an impact. If there is a way we could work together, I would love to know. Feel free to [email me](prajna.soni@nyu.edu) at prajna.soni@nyu.edu.
