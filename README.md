### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Prajna Soni and I'm currently a Postgraduate Research Fellow at NYU Abu Dhabi working on a project to quantify the predictive power of global open datasets in an attempt to mitigate the effects of the global data gap. 

I am a 2020 graduate from New York University Abu Dhabi, with a major in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. My diverse interests lead me to new experiences like scuba diving in the depths of the Borneoâ€™s reefs to working on initiatives which align with the Sustainable Development Goals to eradicate polio from the remaining 2 endemic countries and building a solar powered house.

When not in class, I like to work on short, self-assigned projects to further my skills and abilities, and develop my understanding of the world we live in. My first and foremost passion is learning. Check out my [blog](https://medium.com/@techblurbs) !

I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities where I can apply my skills in engineering, computer science, problem solving, and leadership to create an impact. If there is a way we could work together, I would love to know. Feel free to [email me](prajna.soni@nyu.edu) at prajna.soni@nyu.edu.
